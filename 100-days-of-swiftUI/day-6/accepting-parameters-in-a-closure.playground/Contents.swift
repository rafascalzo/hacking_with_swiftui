//When you create closures, they don’t have a name or space to write any parameters. That doesn’t mean they can’t accept parameters, just that they do so in a different way: they are listed inside the open braces.
//
//To make a closure accept parameters, list them inside parentheses just after the opening brace, then write in so that Swift knows the main body of the closure is starting.
//
//For example, we could make a closure that accepts a place name string as its only parameter like this:

let driving = { (place: String) in
    print("I'm going to \(place) in my car")
}
//One of the differences between functions and closures is that you don’t use parameter labels when running closures. So, to call driving() now we’d write this:

driving("London")

let canIPlayWithMadness = { (bool: Bool) in
    switch bool {
    case true :
        print("Yes")
    case false:
        print("No")
    }
}
canIPlayWithMadness(true)
