import UIKit

//I already said that variables have that name because their values can change over time, and that is often useful. However, very often you want to set a value once and never change it, and so we have an alternative to the var keyword called let.
//
//The let keyword creates constants, which are values that can be set once and never again. For example:

let taylor = "swift"
//If you try to change that, Xcode will refuse to run your code. It’s a form of safety: when you use constants you can no longer change something by accident.
//
//When you write your own Swift code, you should always use let unless you specifically want to change a value. In fact, Xcode will warn you if you use var then don’t change the variable.
