//Swift assigns each variable and constant a type based on what value it’s given when it’s created. So, when you write code like this Swift can see it holds a string:

let str = "Hello, playground"
//That will make str a string, so you can’t try to assign it an integer or a boolean later on. This is called type inference: Swift is able to infer the type of something based on how you created it.
//
//If you want you can be explicit about the type of your data rather than relying on Swift’s type inference, like this:

let album: String = "Reputation"
let year: Int = 1989
let height: Double = 1.78
let taylorRocks: Bool = true
//Notice that booleans have the short type name Bool, in the same way that integers have the short type name Int.
