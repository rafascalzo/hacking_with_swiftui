//The third difference between classes and structs is how they are copied. When you copy a struct, both the original and the copy are different things – changing one won’t change the other. When you copy a class, both the original and the copy point to the same thing, so changing one does change the other.
//
//For example, here’s a simple Singer class that has a name property with a default value:

class Singer {
    var name = "Taylor Swift"
}
//If we create an instance of that class and prints its name, we’ll get “Taylor Swift”:

var singer = Singer()
print(singer.name)
//Now let’s create a second variable from the first one and change its name:

var singerCopy = singer
singerCopy.name = "Justin Bieber"
//Because of the way classes work, both singer and singerCopy point to the same object in memory, so when we print the singer name again we’ll see “Justin Bieber”:

print(singer.name)
//On the other hand, if Singer were a struct then we would get “Taylor Swift” printed a second time:

struct Singer2 {
    var name = "Taylor Swift"
}

var singer2 = Singer2()
var copySinger2 = singer2

copySinger2.name = "Parapapapapa"
print(copySinger2.name)
print(singer2.name)
