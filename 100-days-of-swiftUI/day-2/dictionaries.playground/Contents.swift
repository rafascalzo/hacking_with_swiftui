//Dictionaries are collections of values just like arrays, but rather than storing things with an integer position you can access them using anything you want.
//
//The most common way of storing dictionary data is using strings. For example, we could create a dictionary that stores the height of singers using their name:

let heights = [
    "Taylor Swift": 1.78,
    "Ed Sheeran": 1.73
]
//Just like arrays, dictionaries start and end with brackets and each item is separated with a comma. However, we also use a colon to separate the value you want to store (e.g. 1.78) from the identifier you want to store it under (e.g. “Taylor Swift”).
//
//These identifiers are called keys, and you can use them to read data back out of the dictionary:

heights["Taylor Swift"]
//Note: When using type annotations, dictionaries are written in brackets with a colon between your identifier and value types. For example, [String: Double] and [String: String].
