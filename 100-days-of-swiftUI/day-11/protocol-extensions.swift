//Protocols let you describe what methods something should have, but don’t provide the code inside. Extensions let you provide the code inside your methods, but only affect one data type – you can’t add the method to lots of types at the same time.
//
//Protocol extensions solve both those problems: they are like regular extensions, except rather than extending a specific type like Int you extend a whole protocol so that all conforming types get your changes.
//
//For example, here is an array and a set containing some names:

let pythons = ["Eric", "Graham", "John", "Michael", "Terry", "Terry"]
let beatles = Set(["John", "Paul", "George", "Ringo"])
//Swift’s arrays and sets both conform to a protocol called Collection, so we can write an extension to that protocol to add a summarize() method to print the collection neatly

extension Collection {
    func summarize() {
        print("There are \(count) of us:")
        
        for name in self {
            print(name)
        }
    }
}
//Both Array and Set will now have that method, so we can try it out:

pythons.summarize()
beatles.summarize()
