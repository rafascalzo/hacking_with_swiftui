//This is where closures can start to be read a bit like line noise: a closure you pass into a function can also accept its own parameters.
//
//We’ve been using () -> Void to mean “accepts no parameters and returns nothing”, but you can go ahead and fill the () with the types of any parameters that your closure should accept.
//
//To demonstrate this, we can write a travel() function that accepts a closure as its only parameter, and that closure in turn accepts a string:

func travel(action: (String) -> Void) {
    print("I'm getting ready to go.")
    action("London")
    print("I arrived!")
}
//Now when we call travel() using trailing closure syntax, our closure code is required to accept a string:

travel { (place: String) in
    print("I'm going to \(place) in my car")
}

func tweet(action: (String,String) -> Void) {
    print("I'm getting ready to tweet.")
    action("Day 3","#SwiftOnSundays")
}

tweet {
    print("#100DaysOfSwiftUI \($0) completed! \($1)")
}
